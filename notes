thought process / steps for adding a new bookmark folder / category:

1. untitled, contenteditable paragraphs are hidden
2. user clicks new button to add a new folder
3. the uppermost untitled paragraph shows itself
4. the user clicks on the untitled <p> tag to change the folder name to whatever they want
5. when the user clicks again, anywhere on the page, the <p> that has been edited is saved so that
   when the user visits the page again, the folder name is saved
   when the user clicks new again, the next <p> is shown

   
   instead of having a bunch of untitled elements hidden, create new element w/ js w/ sidebar-item class and contenteditable enabled
